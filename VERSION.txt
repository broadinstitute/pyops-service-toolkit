1.8.1
- Clean up documentation
    - Reformatting all doc-strings so they're uniform and include `args` and `returns` in list formatting (making them
    easier to read)
    - Creating a "home page" for the documentation
    - Updating the docs build GHA so that classes that are not to be used externally are removed (including
        `thread_pool_executor_util` and `tdr_api_schema`)
    - Adding `@private` tags to anything that shouldn't be documented (avoided adding leading underscores to prevent
    breaking changes)
